# **Online Water Delivery Interface**  

## **Project Overview**  
This is an **old web project** made for a final school project. It is a simple system where users can order water delivery online. The website has images, information, and a login system for users. Some small improvements have been made, but the core features remain the same.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **PHP** – Handles forms and connects to the database.  
- **CSS** – Styles the webpage.  
- **HTML** – Builds the webpage structure.  
- **MySQL** – Stores user accounts and orders.  
- **XAMPP** – Used for testing the project locally.  

## **Features**  
- **Simple Online Ordering** – Users can see and order water delivery.  
- **User Login System** – Users can create an account and log in.  
- **Secure Database** – Uses PDO to safely store and get data.  

This project was made for practice and learning but still works as a basic online ordering system.
